In this final project, my game topic is movie names. I have a controller class to display GUI and manage activities related to buttons. I have a class to read my xml file. The new class for this project is called ImagePanel, which extends JPanel so that I can directly add the image in a JPanel in my controller class. From this class, I loaded an image which is a picture of collage of 16 movie posters. I used paintComponent method to paint the image on frame to make this game more vivid. Except the new class, one new thing I learned from making this project is that I know how to use input dialog windows. I chose to use three input dialog windows for the new question, new object, and new answer instead of creating a new JFrame and add buttons and text field on the frame and popping of this frame. Input dialog windows are built in Java and are more convenient to use.

For both my guessing game and unrestricted guessing game, click on start at first to start the game, then the first question will be displayed.

For my unrestricted guessing game, every time the user added a new question and new object, click on start button to restart the game. The new question will be displayed in the new round. So my start button is for both starting at the very beginning and restarting game after question and object have been added.

After all questions have been asked, it will display the movie name. In the guessing game, if the user get to this answer, they click yes button and then a window will pop up stating that they win the game. If they click no button, a window will pop up stating that they lost the game. If they want to restart the game, just click on start button. This game has not been designed to restart game automatically. In the unrestricted guessing game, if the movie name displays and the user clicks on no button, they can then add new question and object.
